# Student Management System (Java)

The **Student Management System** is a simple console-based application built using **Java OOP concepts**. It helps manage student records (ID, Name, and Grade) using a menu-driven approach. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of **classes, objects, methods, constructors, ArrayList, and encapsulation** in Java.

---

## 📖 Objective
The main objective of this project is to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java and understand how to:
- Create and use classes and objects
- Implement encapsulation using private fields and public methods
- Work with **ArrayList** for storing and managing dynamic data
- Build a menu-driven console program for interaction

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Student** → Add new student details (ID, Name, Grade).
- **Remove Student** → Delete a student record by ID.
- **Display Students** → Show the list of all stored students.
- **Menu System** → User-friendly console menu for interaction.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Used
1. **Class & Object** → The `Student` class represents student entities, while objects hold actual data.
2. **Constructor** → Used to initialize student objects with ID, Name, and Grade.
3. **Encapsulation** → Student details are private, accessible via methods.
4. **toString() Method** → Provides a readable format for displaying student details.
5. **ArrayList** → Stores the list of students dynamically.
6. **Methods** → For adding, removing, and displaying student records.
7. **Loop & Switch Case** → Implemented to create a menu-driven system.

---

## 📸 Example Workflow
- Add a student: User provides ID, Name, and Grade → Student added to the list.
- Display students: Shows all current students in formatted output.
- Remove student: User enters an ID → If exists, student is deleted from the list.
- Exit: Ends the program.
